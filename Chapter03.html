<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2><i>Almost there...can you wait for the ending...</i></h2>
<p>When Oisín reached Ireland he found that everything had changed. There was no trace of his father or the fianna. As he passed through Gleann na Smol, the valley of the thrushes, he saw a group of men trying to move a large stone. “You'll never move that” he said and laughed. He turned around and off he went on the horse, across the sea far far away.</p>
<p>he lived happily ever after!...The END!</p>
<p>So you were wondering about the dog...well my dog is called Oisin...the inspiration for my story!</p>
